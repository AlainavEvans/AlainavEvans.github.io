# Show
One of my favorite shows is Mushishi. It's a blend of beautiful landscapes, magical realism, and horror that often leaves me thinking about its episodes for days. The art style makes me want to run off into its misty forests and never leave.

# Movie
One of my favorite movies is Suspiria (1977). It's a surreal horror movie set at a dance academy in Italy. The low production value adds to its surreal atmosphere and makes watching it a very memorable experience.
